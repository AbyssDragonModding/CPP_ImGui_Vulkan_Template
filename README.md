# C++ ImGui Vulkan Template
ImGui template project to use with C++ GLFW and Vulkan.

You probably will have to modify the CMakeLists.txt file if you are on linux, I have not tested it on linux


## Requirements
- CMake 3.15+
- Vulkan SDK

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. open directory in terminal
3. mkdir build
4. cd build
5. cmake ..
It will then download the ImGui (Docking branch) and GLFW Repository, build the lib files and setup the project
